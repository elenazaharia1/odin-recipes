Hi, this is my 1st time using Git/GitHub. I am excited about doing the Odin Project course ^^
This is small project, but when I finish it I will have proved that I can independently use cmd, that I have a basic understanding of HTML elements and boilerplate and of course, that I am able to read documentation.
See you all when I am a full-fledged dev :)
